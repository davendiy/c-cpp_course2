# Tensors

Implementation of tensors (numpy-like arrays) in C++.

The following operations are implemented:

  1. Adding (tensor + number, tensor + tensor)
  
  2. Subtracting (tensor - number, tensor - tensor)
  
  3. Multiplication (tensor * tensor pointwise, tensor * number pointwise)
  
  4. Division
  
  5. Reshaping
  
  6. Copying
  
  7. Getting subtensor
